# Spark

During this pandemic situation Shopping has become a lot more difficult and sopeople opt going for online shopping .But due to some of it disadvantage like they cannot view the thing they buy from all direction , it becomes a problem for the end users.So to get rid of this problem we have made an augmented file which can at present be runned in spark ar player app.In here at present we have provided 2 shopping object which are purse and watch.The users can try out how the purse looks like with their given outfit and choose the colour accordingly.They can also click a picture of it so that they can share the picure among their friends and know their opinion too.All thing user need to do is to provide an image which would be tracked and the 3d model would appear.
